# ChirpStack FUOTA Server

ChirpStack FUOTA Server is an open-source FUOTA server implementation for
LoRaWAN(R). It integrates with the [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/)
using the HTTP integration (for receiving uplink payloads) and uses the
ChirpStack gRCP API for creating the multicast-groups and enqueueing the
downlink payloads.

**Note:** This version is compatible with ChirpStack v4, for v3, please refer
to the [v3 branch](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-fuota-server/tree/v3)
of this repository.

## Building from source

The following commands explain how to compile the source-code using the
provided [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) development
environment.

To start a `bash` shell within this environment:

```
docker-compose run --rm chirpstack-fuota-server bash
```

```
# cleanup workspace
make clean

# run the tests
make test

# compile (this will also compile the ui and generate the static files)
make build

# compile snapshot builds for supported architectures (this will also compile the ui and generate the static files)
make snapshot
```

## API interface

The ChirpStack FUOTA Server provides a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API interface
for scheduling the FUOTA deployments to one or multiple devices under a
ChirpStack application ID. This API is defined by the
gRPC [FuotaServerService](https://github.com/remote-tech/chirpstack-fuota-server/blob/master/api/proto/fuota.proto).

## Setup

After installing the ChirpStack FUOTA Server, there are a couple of steps to
take to setup. Example commands:

### Database setup

The ChirpStack FUOTA Server stores the deployment results into a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database. You must enable the `hstore` extension for this database.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```sql
-- set up the user and password
-- (note that it is important to use single quotes and a semicolon at the end!)
create role chirpstack_fuota with login password 'dbpassword';

-- create the database
create database chirpstack_fuota with owner chirpstack_fuota;

-- change to the ChirpStack FUOTA Server database
\c chirpstack_fuota

-- enable the hstore extension
create extension hstore;

-- exit psql
\q
```

### Create API key

The ChirpStack FUOTA Server needs a ChirpStack API key in order authenticate
with the ChirpStack API. You can generate this key within the ChirpStack
web-interface. This key must be configured in the `chirpstack-fuota-server.toml`
configuration file.

### HTTP integration

Within ChirpStack, you must also setup a HTTP integration for the application(s)
you want to use with the ChirpStack FUOTA Server. Make sure that this matches
with the host / IP and port the ChirpStack FUOTA Server event handler is binding
to. As well make sure that the marshaler matches.

## Usage and configuration file

Please refer to the CLI interface for usage information and for the command to
generate a configuration file:

```
